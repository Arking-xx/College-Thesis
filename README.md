# KENGEN: Simple Programming Language Converter and Syntax Analyzer

KENGEN is a transpiler and syntax analyzer developed by researchers to assist students at Notre Dame of Tacurong College in transitioning between C++ and Python. While C++ is the foundational programming language for computer-related courses, students often hesitate to explore Python due to its perceived complexity. KENGEN addresses this by converting C++ code to Python and vice versa, leveraging insights from the Sinc-Zooming algorithm for efficient translation. The system also incorporates syntax analysis, drawing from studies on parser effectiveness, to ensure accurate code translation. Additionally, it enhances error message readability based on research into factors like length and jargon. The system also has integrated AI for commenting the output translated code, improving code comprehension. By simplifying the exploration of Python, a highly popular programming language, KENGEN empowers students to expand their programming skills and adaptability for their careers.
